### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Im Elias 
### Passionate in creating convenience with practicality in mind.
 ## I am actively seeking job opportunities to leverage my degree and skills in a meaningful way. Currently, I am working as a private hire driver around London, but my passion lies in automation using technology. I am eager to transition into a role where I can contribute and grow professionally.
 
- ðŸŒ± I like learn how things work without limiting to a single category or sector, that helps me think about possible solutions to problems of any kind, knowing one or many possible solutions is the start of solving problmes.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on trip_rating that solves a real world problem for me and would for many. An application that gives insights about trips or journey in seconds.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m currently trying to find a way to more accuratly predict a journey duration with my trip_rating application.
